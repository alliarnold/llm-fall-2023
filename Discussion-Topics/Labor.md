# Labor and AI

Advancements in AI technology, including LLMs like ChatGPT, are disrupting the labor market. Unfortunately, as we have witnessed with industries in transition in the past, the benefits and costs of new technologies are often unevenly distributed. The deployment of LLMs in the workplace will likely create jobs, but we do not know they will create anywhere near as many jobs as they are predicted to destroy. Moreover, we do not know if the jobs that will be created by AI will offer comparable levels of intellectual enrichment and financial renumerations for workers as those jobs being destroyed. Some people and corporations, especially those already well positioned, will greatly expand their fortunes through cost cutting measures and new products made available by AI. However, we have significant reasons to worry that AI will result in further consolidations of weath, reductions in wages and workers rights, and significant drops in job fulfillment. Governments owe it their constituents to take actions to pause and regulate the release of AI technologies.
