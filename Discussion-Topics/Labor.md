# Labor and AI

Advancements in AI technology, including LLMs like ChatGPT, are disrupting the labor market. Unfortunately, as we have witnessed with industries in transition in the past, the benefits and costs of new technologies are often unevenly distributed. The deployment of LLMs in the workplace will create new jobs, but we do not know if they will create anywhere near as many jobs as they are predicted to destroy. Moreover, we do not know if the jobs that will be created by AI will offer comparable levels of intellectual fulfillment and financial remuneration for workers as those jobs that are being eliminated. Some people and corporations, especially those already well-positioned, will greatly expand their fortunes through the cost-cutting measures and new products made available by AI. However, we have significant reasons to worry that AI will result in further consolidations of wealth, reductions in wages and workers' rights, and drops in job satisfaction. Governments owe it to their constituents to take action to pause and regulate the release of AI technologies in the workforce.
